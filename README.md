# mission-to-mars
### Purpose
   The purpose of this exercise was to utilize beautifulsoup, splinter and mongodb to scrape websites. The websites in question were Mars related in their contents. The splinter module allowed me to explore using the browser method, and in conjuction with beautifulsoup I was able to parse trhough the html code to return various parts of information.
